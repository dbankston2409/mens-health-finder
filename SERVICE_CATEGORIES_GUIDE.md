## How the Web Scraping Works

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// The scraper uses Node.js with Cheerio (jQuery-like server-side DOM manipulation)
const response = await fetch(websiteUrl, { 
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...', // Appears as regular browser
    'Accept': 'text/html...',
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
  },
  timeout: 10000 
});

const html = await response.text();
const $ = cheerio.load(html); // Parse HTML like jQuery
```

### Scraping Process
1. **Initial Request**: Fetches homepage HTML
2. **DOM Parsing**: Uses Cheerio to parse and query HTML
3. **Content Analysis**: Searches for service keywords in:
   - Headings (h1, h2, h3, h4)
   - List items (service lists)
   - Paragraphs with service mentions
   - Elements with service-related classes
4. **Page Discovery**: Finds links to service/treatment pages
5. **Multi-page Scraping**: Visits up to 5 relevant pages
6. **Respectful Delays**: 1-second pause between requests
