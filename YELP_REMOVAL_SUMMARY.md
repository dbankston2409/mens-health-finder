# Yelp Removal & Database Optimization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Yelp Removal (✅ Complete)
- **Removed 52+ Yelp references** from the codebase
- **Deleted Yelp icon files** from public/images/icons/
- **Updated type definitions** to remove Yelp fields:
  - Removed `yelpBusinessId`, `yelpRating`, `yelpReviewCount`
  - Removed `YelpPhoto` interface
  - Updated `photos` structure to use URLs only
- **Cleaned up components** that displayed Yelp data
- **Updated review aggregation** to exclude Yelp

### 2. Photo Storage Optimization (✅ Complete)
Changed from storing full photo objects to URLs only:
```typescript
// OLD:
photos?: {
  google?: GooglePhoto[];
  yelp?: YelpPhoto[];
  hero?: string;
  gallery?: string[];
};

// NEW:
photos?: {
  googlePhotoUrls?: string[];
  hero?: string;
  gallery?: string[];
};
```

### 3. Optimized Clinic Structure (✅ Complete)
Created new `OptimizedClinic` interface that:
- **Reduces from 97+ fields to ~35 essential fields**
- **Preserves business hours** (as requested)
- **Preserves payment methods** (as requested)
- **Keeps actual review content** (moved to subcollections)
- **Only stores photos for paid clinics** (as requested)

### 4. Migration Script (✅ Complete)
Created `migrate-to-optimized-structure.js` that:
- Migrates existing clinics to optimized structure
- Moves reviews to subcollections for better performance
- Removes all Yelp data during migration
- Preserves business hours and payment methods
- Only migrates photo URLs for paid clinics

## Key Changes

### Database Structure Before:
- 97+ fields per clinic document
- Mixed Yelp/Google data
- Full photo objects stored
- Reviews embedded in main document
- Redundant fields and timestamps

### Database Structure After:
- ~35 essential fields per clinic
- NO Yelp data
- Photo URLs only (paid clinics only)
- Reviews in subcollections
- Clean, optimized structure

### Fields Preserved (Per Request):
1. **Business Hours** - Structured format for easy display
2. **Payment Methods** - Boolean flags for filtering
3. **Actual Reviews** - Full content in subcollections
4. **Photo URLs** - Only for paid clinics

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: Execute the migration script when ready:
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-to-optimized-structure.js
   ```

2. **Update Components**: Ensure all components use the new structure

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all features work without Yelp data

4. **Monitor Performance**: The optimized structure should significantly improve:
   - Query performance
   - Storage costs
   - Data transfer speeds

## Cost Savings
- **Yelp API**: $600/month eliminated
- **Firestore Storage**: ~65% reduction in document size
- **Bandwidth**: Reduced data transfer costs

## Important Notes
- All Yelp references have been removed
- The system no longer depends on Yelp data
- Photo storage is now URL-only
- Reviews are now in subcollections for better performance
- Only paid clinics will have photos stored
