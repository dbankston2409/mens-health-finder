# Website Scraping Solution for Enhanced Clinic Data

## Overview

You're absolutely right - Google Places API provides basic information but lacks detailed service offerings. I've created a comprehensive website scraping solution that:

1. **Automatically visits clinic websites** after Google Places discovery
2. **Extracts detailed service information** using intelligent pattern matching
3. **Normalizes the data** into standardized service categories
4. **Generates hyper-specific SEO content** based on actual services offered
5. **Creates service-specific FAQs** automatically

## How It Works

### 1. Discovery Flow with Scraping

```
Google Places Discovery → Basic Clinic Info → Website Scraping → Enhanced Data → SEO Generation
```

### 2. Website Scraper (`websiteScraper.ts`)

The scraper uses multiple strategies to find services:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Looks for 25+ service categories with 100+ keyword variations
- **Multi-page Analysis**: Automatically finds and scrapes service pages
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rates each found service 0-1 based on context
- **Price Extraction**: Captures pricing when available
- **Smart Navigation**: Follows links containing service-related keywords

#### Service Categories Detected:

**Hormone Therapy**
- TRT (testosterone replacement therapy, low t treatment, etc.)
- HGH (human growth hormone, somatropin, sermorelin)
- Peptide Therapy (BPC-157, TB-500, ipamorelin, etc.)

**Sexual Health**
- ED Treatment (viagra, cialis, trimix, GAINSWave, P-shot)
- Premature Ejaculation treatments
- Peyronie's Disease (xiaflex)

**Weight & Metabolic**
- Weight Loss (semaglutide, Ozempic, Wegovy, tirzepatide)
- B12 Injections
- Lipotropic Injections

**Hair & Aesthetics**
- Hair Restoration (finasteride, minoxidil, PRP)
- Aesthetics (Botox, fillers)

**Wellness & Advanced Treatments**
- IV Therapy (Myers cocktail, NAD+, glutathione)
- Cryotherapy
- Red Light Therapy
- Stem Cell Therapy
- And 15+ more categories...

### 3. Enhanced SEO Generator (`enhancedSeoGenerator.ts`)

Uses scraped data to create highly specific content:

```typescript
// Example of enhanced content generation
const prompt = `Generate content for ${clinic.name} featuring these VERIFIED services:

**TRT Services Found:**
- "Low T treatment starting at $199/month"
- "Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy"
- "Weekly testosterone injections or pellets"

**Weight Loss Programs:**
- "Semaglutide weight loss program"
- "Medical weight loss with GLP-1 medications"
- "B12 and lipotropic injections included"
```

### 4. Enrichment Pipeline (`clinicEnrichmentPipeline.ts`)

Automated pipeline that:
- Processes clinics after Google Places import
- Runs website scraping
- Generates enhanced SEO content (700-1,000 words)
- Creates service-specific FAQs
- Updates clinic records with verified services

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Discovery Process

In your discovery orchestrator, add website enrichment:

```typescript
// After saving clinic from Google Places
const clinic = await this.saveClinic(placeDetails);

// Queue for enrichment
await this.queueForEnrichment(clinic);
```

### Step 2: Run Enrichment Pipeline

```typescript
// Can run as scheduled job or on-demand
import { ClinicEnrichmentPipeline } from './clinicEnrichmentPipeline';

const pipeline = new ClinicEnrichmentPipeline();

// Find clinics needing enrichment
const clinicsToEnrich = await pipeline.findClinicsNeedingEnrichment(50);

// Run enrichment with web scraping
const results = await pipeline.enrichMultipleClinics(clinicsToEnrich, {
  maxConcurrent: 3, // Process 3 at a time
  delayMs: 3000 // 3 second delay between batches
});
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd apps/worker
npm install cheerio node-fetch
npm install --save-dev @types/cheerio
```

## Benefits Over Google Places Alone

### Google Places Provides:
- Name, address, phone
- Basic category (e.g., "Medical Clinic")
- Hours of operation
- Reviews and ratings

### Website Scraping Adds:
- **Specific Services**: "Semaglutide weight loss", "GAINSWave for ED", "BPC-157 peptide therapy"
- **Pricing Information**: "TRT starting at $199/month"
- **Treatment Details**: "Weekly injections", "90-day pellets", "Telemedicine available"
- **Specializations**: "Anti-aging", "Sports medicine", "Executive health"
- **Insurance/Financing**: Accepts specific insurances, offers CareCredit
- **Unique Offerings**: Proprietary treatments, specialized equipment

## Example Results

### Before (Google Places Only):
```
Name: Men's Health Clinic of Dallas
Services: ["Medical Clinic"]
Description: Generic medical clinic description
```

### After (With Website Scraping):
```
Name: Men's Health Clinic of Dallas
Services: [
  "TRT - Testosterone Replacement Therapy",
  "ED Treatment - GAINSWave & P-Shot",
  "Medical Weight Loss - Semaglutide Program",
  "Peptide Therapy - BPC-157, TB-500",
  "IV Therapy - NAD+ and Myers Cocktail"
]
Pricing: {
  "TRT": "$199-299/month",
  "GAINSWave": "$500/session",
  "Semaglutide": "$399/month"
}
Specializations: ["Anti-aging", "Sports Performance"]
Insurance: Accepts most major insurances
Financing: CareCredit available
```

## SEO Content Comparison

### Generic (Without Scraping):
"Men's Health Clinic of Dallas offers comprehensive men's health services including hormone therapy and wellness treatments..."

### Enhanced (With Scraping):
"Men's Health Clinic of Dallas specializes in cutting-edge treatments including GAINSWave acoustic therapy for ED, bioidentical testosterone replacement starting at $199/month, and medical weight loss with Semaglutide. Their state-of-the-art facility offers peptide protocols like BPC-157 for recovery and TB-500 for healing, along with NAD+ IV therapy for cellular optimization..."

## Handling Edge Cases

1. **No Website**: Falls back to Google Places data only
2. **Blocked Scraping**: Respects robots.txt, uses user-agent headers
3. **Dynamic Sites**: Can be enhanced with Puppeteer for JavaScript sites
4. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
5. **Failed Scraping**: Marks for manual review, doesn't block import

## Cost Considerations

- **No API costs** (unlike Yelp's $600/month)
- **Minimal server resources** (runs async in background)
- **Respectful scraping** (delays, user-agent, robots.txt)
- **One-time scrape** with periodic updates (90 days)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the scraping solution**
2. **Run on existing clinics** to enhance their data
3. **Monitor results** and tune confidence thresholds
4. **Add to import workflow** for all new clinics
5. **Set up scheduled re-enrichment** (quarterly)

This solution gives you the detailed, specific data needed to generate truly amazing SEO content that stands out from generic clinic listings!
